1fe supports webpack externals via the 1fe/cli. This allows widgets to exclude common libraries from output bundles.

### Why Externalize Libraries?

We can reduce widget bundle sizes and improve app load time (ALT) by sharing commonly used libraries at the 1fe shell level, aka “externalizing” them.

### How are libraries externalized within 1fe?

Via webpack externals, 1fe/cli will automatically externalize libraries that are configured to be externalized within your hosted live configurations.

The version string you see in a widget’s `package.json` is an illusion of control. At runtime, when the widget is rendered by the 1fe shell, the 1fe/shell will load the version specified version within the live configurations instead.
