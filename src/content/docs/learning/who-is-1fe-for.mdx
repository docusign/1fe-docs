1fe is designed for **UI Platform teams** at organizations who need to provide ecosystem-wide standards and tooling. The platform team makes foundational decisions that benefit the entire organization.

## <FcOrganization style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Target Organizations

1fe is **not built to be adopted by individuals**, but rather by **UI Platform teams** at medium to large organizations. The goal is to provide an ecosystem that allows the platform team to build and maintain tooling, guidance, and standards that can be utilized by the rest of the organization without effort or overhead.

### Ideal Organizational Structure

- **Platform Team** - Owns 1fe infrastructure, standards, and shared tooling
- **Product Teams** - Build widgets and experiences using platform-provided tools
- **Cross-Team Collaboration** - Need for shared components and consistent experiences

### Signs Your Organization Needs 1fe

- **Frontend fragmentation** across multiple teams and products
- **Redundant infrastructure** being built by different teams
- **Slow development cycles** due to coordination overhead
- **High maintenance costs** from multiple build systems and deployment pipelines

## <FcSettings style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Platform Team Responsibilities

The 1fe platform team makes foundational decisions that benefit the entire organization across several key areas:

### Code Authoring Standards

- **Node.js version** for build and tooling consistency
- **TypeScript configuration** and version management
- **React version** and upgrade strategies
- **ESLint rules** for strict/non-strict modes across teams

### Testing Infrastructure

- **Unit testing framework** selection and configuration
- **E2E testing** patterns and shared utilities

### Build System Management

- **Bundler selection** and optimization (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
- **Asset handling** for images, fonts, and static resources
- **Library externalization** for shared dependencies

### Deployment Abstraction

> _Completely abstracted from product teams_

- **CI/CD pipeline** templates and best practices
- **CDN provider** selection and configuration
- **Asset bundling** and deployment strategies
- **Caching strategies** for optimal performance
- **Performance optimization** built into the platform

### Runtime Configuration

- **Authentication strategies** enabled via live configuration
- **Feature flags** and experimentation frameworks
- **Route management** per product and environment
- **Progressive rollout** capabilities

### Platform Utilities

- **Helper functions** available out of the box to all widgets
- **UI logging** integration and error tracking

## <FcTimeline style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Product Team Benefits

While the platform team manages the infrastructure, product teams get significant benefits:

### Reduced Cognitive Load

- **No infrastructure decisions** - Focus purely on product features
- **Standardized tooling** - Same patterns across all projects
- **Automatic updates** - Platform improvements benefit all teams
- **Consistent developer experience** - Easy to switch between projects

### Faster Development

- **Pre-configured environments** - Start building immediately
- **Shared components** - Reuse UI elements across products
- **Platform utilities** - Common functionality built-in
- **Independent deployments** - Deploy when ready, not when coordinated

### Quality by Default

- **Enforced standards** - Linting, testing, and formatting built-in
- **Performance optimization** - Best practices applied automatically
- **Security policies** - CSP and other protections managed centrally
- **Accessibility compliance** - Standards enforced across all widgets

## Common Concerns and Solutions

### "One size fits all won't work for our unique needs"

**Reality**: 1fe is designed to be extensible. Special requirements can be accommodated through platform extensions and customizations.

### "This adds another layer of complexity"

**Reality**: 1fe reduces complexity for product teams by centralizing it in the platform team. The total organizational complexity decreases significantly.

### "We'll be dependent on the platform team"

**Reality**: Good platform teams enable independence, not dependence. The goal is to make product teams more autonomous, not less.
