##### 3. What just happened?

1. 1FE loaded and rendered the *plugin* tied to the `/widget-starter-kit` route.

2. When `utils.context.get` was clicked, the plugin loaded a child *widget* via the *platform utilities* provided by 1FE shell.

:::tip
1FE loads the latest widget bundles and assets from a CDN. This allows for a dynamic ecosystem where monolithic apps can be broken into smaller plugins and widgets repositories, each with their own release cycles. This is a key feature of 1FE.
