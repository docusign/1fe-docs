Let's get your 1fe instance ready for production! We shall cover the following topics in this guide:

## Quick Start Checklist

:::tip[Recommended Setup Order]
Follow these steps in order for the smoothest setup experience:

1. ✅ [Setup Hosting Service](/infrastructure/hosting-setup/) - Deploy your 1FE application
2. ✅ [Setup CDN](/infrastructure/cdn-setup/) - Configure widget bundle hosting  
3. ✅ [Setup NPM Registry](/infrastructure/npm-registry-setup/) - Manage NPM packages
4. ✅ [Setup Configuration Service](/infrastructure/configuration-setup/) - Manage live configurations
5. ✅ [Setup CI/CD](/infrastructure/project-setup/) - Automate deployments
:::

Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring your production infrastructure is robust and scalable.

## 1. Setup a Hosting Service for Your 1fe Instance

Your 1FE application shell needs to be hosted on a reliable service that can handle user traffic and serve your application globally.

**[→ Detailed Hosting Setup Guide](/infrastructure/hosting-setup/)**

## 2. Setup a Static Hosting Service for Your Bundles

You can use a CDN service to host your built widget bundles for both integration and production environments.

**[→ Detailed CDN Setup Guide](/infrastructure/cdn-setup/)**


## 3. Setup a NPM Registry

A private NPM registry is essential for managing your 1FE widget packages securely and efficiently in a production environment.

**[→ Detailed NPM Registry Setup Guide](/infrastructure/npm-registry-setup/)**

## 4. Setup a Configuration Service

### Why Configuration Service is Needed

1FE requires a configuration service to manage **widget metadata** including version information, deployment status, and dependencies.


**[→ Detailed Configuration Service Setup Guide](/infrastructure/configuration-setup/)**

## 5. Setup a CI/CD System

1FE uses a centralized CI/CD system to manage deployments across all widgets.
