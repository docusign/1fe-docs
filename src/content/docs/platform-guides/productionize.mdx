Let's get your 1fe instance ready for production! We shall cover the following topics in this guide:

<div className="prose">
1. **Setup a hosting service for your 1fe instance.**
2. **Setup a static hosting service for your bundles.**
3. **Setup a npm registry.**
4. **Setup a configuration service.**
5. **Setup a CI/CD system.**
</div>

## 1. Setup a Hosting Service for Your 1FE Instance

Your 1FE application shell needs to be hosted on a reliable service that can handle user traffic and serve your application globally.

**[→ Detailed Hosting Setup Guide](/infrastructure/hosting-setup/)**

This comprehensive guide covers:
- Azure Web App setup with GitHub Actions integration
- Custom domain configuration
- Environment variable management
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Security best practices and monitoring

## 2. Setup a Static Hosting Service for Your Bundles


**[→ Detailed CDN Setup Guide](/infrastructure/cdn-setup/)**

This comprehensive guide covers:
- Akamai NetStorage implementation with step-by-step configuration
- CI/CD integration and automated deployment with rsync
- Security best practices and SSH key management
- Troubleshooting and monitoring
- References to production-ready examples in 1fe-ci-cd and mock-cdn-assets repositories

## 3. Setup a NPM Registry

A private NPM registry is essential for managing your 1FE widget packages securely and efficiently in a production environment.

**[→ Detailed NPM Registry Setup Guide](/infrastructure/npm-registry-setup/)**

This comprehensive guide covers:
- GitHub Packages, Azure Artifacts, and AWS CodeArtifact setup
- Self-hosted solutions like Verdaccio
- Package structure and CI/CD integration
- Security best practices and monitoring

## 4. Setup a Configuration Service

### Why Configuration Service is Needed

1FE requires a configuration service to manage:
- **Widget metadata** - Version information, deployment status, and dependencies
- **Live configurations** - Runtime settings that can be updated without redeployment
- **Environment-specific settings** - Different configurations for integration and production
- **Feature flags** - Dynamic enabling/disabling of features across widgets

**[→ Detailed Configuration Service Setup Guide](/infrastructure/configuration-setup/)**

This comprehensive guide covers:
- Azure App Configuration setup with our implementation details
- Alternative solutions (AWS Parameter Store, HashiCorp Consul)
- Integration with 1FE shell and real-time updates
- Security best practices and monitoring

## 5. Setup a CI/CD System

### Why CI/CD for 1FE?

**[→ CI/CD Project Setup Documentation](/platform-guides/project-setup/)**

## Quick Start Checklist
