**This is a POC deployment guide!**

We are using public tooling in this guide to get something out on the internet so you can showcase your 1fe instance. If you're ready to set up a production environment with proper CDN infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and robust hosting, visit our [productionization guide](/how-to-guides/productionize).

### Setup the required github repositories

You need two github repositories:

**CDN Assets Repository**

You need a repository for the `mock-cdn-assets` that will hold our assets. We will be using JSDelivr to serve these assets. JSDelivr works off of GitHub repositories and serves files based on Git tags. We already created a repository for our forked cdn assets on github.com and pushed our changes to that repository as part of the guide to get our setup locally. If you haven't done that, do that now so our mock-cdn-assets are available on github.com for JSDelivr to pick up from.

**1fe Instance Repository**

You need a repository for your 1fe instance that will be used to deploy your 1fe instance.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy our assets to a CDN

We have already learnt how to host assets locally in the previous guide. Let's deploy to them a CDN so our hosted 1fe instance can access them. For this process, we will need to

### Configure the 1fe instance first

For this section, lets assume that you are going to use a git tag for your CDN assets like `v1.0.2`. You can pick any tag you like, but make sure to use the same tag in the next steps. We will use `<tag>` to refer to this tag in the rest of this guide. Based on this information (and with some more steps that you will take later), you need to make the following changes to your 1fe instance files.

1.  Point your 1fe instance to the new CDN assets for **live configurations**. What are those? **[They're pretty neat](/learning/live-configurations/)** - you can update things without redeploying! üîÑ These files will be checked in in the next step but we prepare the 1fe instance for it now.

    ```tsx title="src/config/ecosystem-configs.ts" {4,7,10}
    // ...
    export const configManagement: OneFEConfigManagement = {
      widgetVersions: {
        url: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/integration/configs/widget-versions.json`,
      },
      libraryVersions: {
        url: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/integration/configs/lib-versions.json`,
      },
      dynamicConfigs: {
        url: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/integration/configs/live.json`,
      },
      refreshMs: 30 * 1000,
    };
    ```

2.  Point your 1fe instance to the new CDN assets for critical libraries.

    ```tsx title="src/config/ecosystem-configs.ts" {3,5,9,10}
    // ...
    const shellBundleUrl =
      isLocal || SERVER_BUILD_NUMBER === "local"
        ? `http://localhost:3001/js/bundle.js`
        : `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/${ENVIRONMENT}/shell/${SERVER_BUILD_NUMBER}/js/bundle.js`;

    const importMapOverrideUrl = isProduction
      ? `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/${ENVIRONMENT}/libs/@1fe/import-map-overrides/3.1.1/dist/import-map-overrides-api.js`
      : `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/${ENVIRONMENT}/libs/@1fe/import-map-overrides/3.1.1/dist/import-map-overrides.js`;

    export const criticalLibUrls = {
      importMapOverride: importMapOverrideUrl,
      systemJS: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/${ENVIRONMENT}/libs/systemjs/6.14.0/dist/system.min.js`,
      systemJSAmd: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@<tag>/${ENVIRONMENT}/libs/systemjs/6.14.0/dist/extras/amd.min.js`,
      shellBundleUrl,
    };
    ```

3.  Update the CSP policy.
    Update the CSP policies as defined in `src/csp-configs.ts` to allow jsdelivr domains(`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`)
4.  Now check this into your 1fe instance repository. That can help with deploying your 1fe instance later.

### Add the 1fe instance bundle to the CDN

When working on getting our setup to work locally, we already uploaded bundles for `widget-starter-kit` and `playground` to the CDN. We need to upload the shell bundle.

You need to pick a random number to act as a build number for your 1fe instance. This will be used to create a unique folder in the CDN for your 1fe instance. Lets call it `<build-number>`.

1.  Build the 1fe instance again using `yarn build`
2.  Copy the bundle over to your `mock-cdn-assets` repository like so:

```bash
mkdir -p mock-cdn-assets/integration/shell/<build-number>/
cp -r <test-app-name>/dist/public/ mock-cdn-assets/integration/shell/<build-number>/
```

### Create and Push Tags for JSDelivr

Let's now add all the changes you have made to your CDN assets repository and create a the git tag for them. This is crucial for JSDelivr to cache the assets and serve them correctly.

1.  **Create and push a Git tag:**

    ```bash
    cd mock-cdn-assets
    git remote
    git add .
    git tag v1.0.2 # Use your chosen tag here
    git push origin main
    git push origin v1.0.2 # Push the tag to GitHub
    ```

2.  **Your assets are now publicly accessible via JSDelivr URLs:**

    ```
    # Widget Starter Kit Bundle
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/mock-cdn-assets@v1.0.2/integration/widgets/@1fe/widget-starter-kit/<version>/js/1fe-bundle.js

    # playground Widget Bundle
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@v1.0.2/integration/widgets/@1fe/playground/<version>/js/1fe-bundle.js

    # Live Configurations
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>@v1.0.2/integration/configs/live.json
    ```

:::tip
**JSDelivr not reflecting your changes?** Try purging the cache at https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge. Changes typically appear within a few minutes.

## üåê Deploy our 1fe instance to a hosting service

Now that we have our CDN setup, let's deploy our 1fe instance to a hosted service such that it's pointing to our CDN.

### Deploy the 1fe instance

Your 1fe instance is now ready to be deployed to a server. You can choose any hosting service of your choice that is capable of serving a nodejs express app. Below are some services you can use and their documentation links to help you deploy your 1fe instance.

| Service                                                          | Documentation                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Render](https://render.com/)                                    | https://render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app                                                                     |

As a quick start, you can also use the links below with your 1fe instance repository URL to deploy it to either Render or Heroku.

**Render Deployment**

`https://render.com/deploy?repo=<your-1fe-repo-url>`

**Heroku Deployment**

`https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=<your-1fe-repo-url>`

After you have deployed your 1fe instance, you will be able to access it at the URL provided by your hosting service!
