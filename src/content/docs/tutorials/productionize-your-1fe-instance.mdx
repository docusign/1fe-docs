Let's transform your 1fe development setup into enterprise-grade production infrastructure. You'll set up hosting, CDN, NPM registry, configuration service, and CI/CD pipeline.

This tutorial is for platform teams who have completed the [Setup and Deploy a 1fe POC](/tutorials/setup-and-deploy-1fe-poc/) tutorial and are ready to move to production.

**Prerequisites:** A working 1fe instance with at least one widget, administrative access to cloud infrastructure, and understanding of CI/CD concepts.

## What We're Building

**[üè¢ Production Hosting](#üè¢-production-hosting)** - Scalable hosting service for your 1fe instance (~45 min)  
**[‚òÅÔ∏è CDN Setup](#‚òÅÔ∏è-cdn-setup)** - Content delivery network for widget bundles (~30 min)  
**[üì¶ NPM Registry](#üì¶-npm-registry)** - Private package management and distribution (~20 min)  
**[üóÑ Configuration Service](#üóÑ-configuration-service)** - Dynamic settings and metadata management (~25 min)  
**[üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline](#üîÑ-cicd-pipeline)** - Automated deployments and rollbacks (~60 min)

Let's start building production infrastructure.

## üè¢ Production Hosting

Set up production hosting for your 1fe application shell. This will handle user traffic and serve your application globally with proper scaling and monitoring.

### Setup Production Hosting

Follow our detailed hosting setup guide:

**[‚Üí Hosting Service Setup Guide](/how-to-guides/infrastructure-setup/hosting-setup/)**

This covers:

<div class="prose">

- Production hosting service (Azure Web App, AWS, etc.)
- Environment variables for production configuration
- SSL/TLS security and monitoring

</div>

### Verify Setup

After completing the setup:

<div class="prose">

- Your 1fe instance loads from the production URL
- SSL certificate is properly configured
- Environment variables are accessible
- Monitoring is collecting logs and metrics

</div>

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è CDN Setup

You need a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to efficiently deliver your widget bundles to users worldwide with fast loading times and global caching.

### What You'll Set Up

<div class="prose">

- **Global CDN infrastructure** for widget bundle delivery
- **Caching policies** and compression settings
- **SSL/TLS security** for content delivery
- **Cache invalidation** for deploying updates

</div>

### Complete Setup Guide

Follow our detailed step-by-step guide for CDN setup:

**[‚Üí CDN Setup Guide](/how-to-guides/infrastructure-setup/cdn-setup/)**

### Verification

After completing the setup, verify:

<div class="prose">

- Widget bundles load quickly from global CDN
- Caching policies are working correctly
- SSL certificates are properly configured
- Cache invalidation works for updates

</div>

### Key Benefits

**Performance**: Faster loading times for users worldwide
**Scalability**: Handle traffic spikes automatically
**Reliability**: Redundant infrastructure reduces downtime
**Cost Efficiency**: Reduced bandwidth costs from origin servers

## üì¶ NPM Registry

A private NPM registry is essential for managing your 1fe widget packages securely and efficiently in a production environment.

### What You'll Set Up

<div class="prose">

- **Private NPM registry** for internal widget packages
- **Access controls** and authentication
- **CI/CD integration** for automated publishing
- **Package versioning** with changesets

</div>

### Complete Setup Guide

Follow our detailed step-by-step guide for NPM registry setup:

**[‚Üí NPM Registry Setup Guide](/how-to-guides/infrastructure-setup/npm-registry-setup/)**

### Verification

After completing the setup, verify:

<div class="prose">

- Widgets can be published to private registry
- Access controls are working properly
- CI/CD pipeline can authenticate and publish
- Package versioning follows organization standards

</div>

### Registry Benefits

**Security**: Keep internal packages private and secure
**Control**: Manage access and permissions centrally
**Performance**: Faster package installation for teams
**Compliance**: Meet enterprise security requirements

## üóÑ Configuration Service

1fe requires a configuration service to manage **widget metadata** including version information, deployment status, and dependencies without code changes.

### What You'll Set Up

<div class="prose">

- **Configuration service** (Azure App Configuration, AWS Parameter Store, etc.)
- **Environment-specific configurations** for different deployment stages
- **Live configuration updates** without application restarts
- **Version management** for widget deployments

</div>

### Complete Setup Guide

Follow our detailed step-by-step guide for configuration service setup:

**[‚Üí Configuration Service Setup Guide](/how-to-guides/infrastructure-setup/configuration-setup/)**

### Configuration Structure

**Widget Versions** (`widget-versions.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "widgetId": "@company/user-dashboard",
    "version": "1.2.3"
  },
  {
    "widgetId": "@company/analytics-widget",
    "version": "2.1.0"
  }
]
```

**Live Configuration** (`live.json`):

```json
{
  "libraries": {
    "basePrefix": "https://cdn.company.com/libs/"
  },
  "widgets": {
    "basePrefix": "https://cdn.company.com/widgets/",
    "configs": [
      {
        "widgetId": "@company/user-dashboard",
        "plugin": {
          "enabled": true,
          "route": "/dashboard"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verification

After completing the setup, verify:

<div class="prose">

- Configuration service responds correctly
- Environment-specific configs load properly
- Widget versions update without restarts
- Configuration changes deploy automatically

</div>

### Configuration Benefits

**Dynamic Updates**: Change widget versions without code deployment
**Environment Management**: Separate configs for dev/staging/prod
**Feature Flags**: Enable/disable widgets dynamically
**Rollback Capability**: Quick revert to previous configurations

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

1fe uses a centralized CI/CD system to manage deployments across all widgets with automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

### What You'll Set Up

<div class="prose">

- **Automated build pipelines** for your 1fe instance and widgets
- **Multi-environment deployment** with approval workflows
- **Automated rollback capabilities** for quick issue resolution
- **Testing automation** and quality gates
