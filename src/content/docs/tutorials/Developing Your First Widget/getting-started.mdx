Welcome to widget development! In this step, you'll set up your development environment and get familiar with the widget development workflow.

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this step, you'll have:

<div class="prose">

- **Development environment ready** - All prerequisites installed and configured
- **Widget starter kit cloned** - Your own copy of the widget template
- **Development server running** - Local widget development environment active
- **Project structure understanding** - Know how widget projects are organized

</div>

## 🏢 Check With Your Organization First

Before diving into the standard tools, **check with your platform team** to see if your organization provides:

<div class="prose">

- **Custom widget starter kit** - Organization-specific template with company standards
- **Internal development guidelines** - Company-specific setup instructions
- **Custom development tools** - Organization-specific CLI tools or workflows
- **Internal widget registry** - Private package registry for dependencies

</div>

If your organization has custom tools, use those instead! The concepts in this tutorial will still apply.

## 🔧 Prerequisites Check

Ensure you have the following installed:

### Node.js and Package Manager

```bash
# Check Node.js version (22+ required)
node --version

# Check yarn version
yarn --version
```

## 📦 Cloning the Widget Starter Kit

Let's get the standard 1fe widget starter kit:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the widget starter kit
git clone https://github.com/docusign/1fe-widget-starter-kit.git my-first-widget

# Navigate to the project
cd my-first-widget
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for widget development

### 3. Explore the Project Structure

Let's understand what you just cloned:

```
my-first-widget/
├── src/                    # Your widget source code
│   ├── components/         # Reusable React components
│   ├── contract.ts         # Widget contract definition
│   ├── app1.tsx           # Main widget entry point
│   └── widget.ts          # Default widget export
├── tests/                  # Test files
├── .1fe.config.ts         # Widget build and runtime configuration
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## 🏗️ Understanding Key Files

### Widget Entry Point (`src/app1.tsx`)

This is your main widget component:

```typescript title="src/app1.tsx"
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { platformProps } from "@1fe/shell";
import { WidgetProps } from "./contract";

const MyWidget: React.FC<WidgetProps> = (props) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Widget initialization
    platformProps.utils.appLoadTime.end();
    console.log("Hello from my first widget!");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My First Widget</h1>
      <p>Welcome to 1fe widget development!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyWidget;
```

### Widget Contract (`src/contract.ts`)

Defines the interface between your widget and the platform:

```typescript title="src/contract.ts"
export interface WidgetProps {
  // Define the props your widget expects
  title?: string;
  theme?: "light" | "dark";
  // Add more props as needed
}
```

### Configuration (`.1fe.config.ts`)

Controls how your widget is built and deployed:

```typescript title=".1fe.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@1fe/cli";

export default defineConfig({
  widget: {
    name: "my-first-widget",
    entry: "src/app1.tsx",
  },
  // Additional configuration options
});
```

## 🚀 Starting the Development Server

Now let's get your widget running locally:

```bash
# Start the development server
yarn dev

# Or with npm
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to:

```
✓ Widget development server started
✓ Widget bundle available at: http://localhost:8080/js/1fe-bundle.js
✓ Ready for development!
```

**What just happened?**

- The 1fe CLI compiled your widget
- Started a local development server
- Made your widget available at a local URL
- Enabled hot reloading for development

## 🔍 Verifying Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working:

### 1. Check the Bundle URL

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/js/1fe-bundle.js
```

You should see JavaScript code (the compiled widget bundle).

### 2. Check Development Logs

In your terminal, you should see:

- No TypeScript errors
- Successful compilation messages
- Hot reload ready status

### 3. Make a Test Change

Edit `src/app1.tsx` and change the heading:

```typescript title="src/app1.tsx" {8}
return (
  <div>
    <h1>My Awesome First Widget!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to 1fe widget development!</p>
  </div>
);
```

Save the file and watch your terminal - you should see the widget recompile automatically.

## 📁 Understanding Widget Architecture

### Platform Integration

Your widget runs within the 1fe platform and has access to:

<div class="prose">

- **Platform utilities** - Shared functions for logging, navigation, etc.
- **Shared dependencies** - React, design systems, and common libraries
- **Shell context** - Platform-wide state and configuration
- **Event system** - Communication with other widgets and the shell

</div>

### Development Workflow

The typical development cycle is:

1. **Code** - Write widget functionality in `src/`
2. **Test** - Use the playground for immediate feedback
3. **Build** - Compile with `yarn build:widget`
4. **Deploy** - Push to your organization's deployment pipeline

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Before moving to the next step, ensure:

<div class="prose">

- [ ] **Node.js 18+** installed and working
- [ ] **Widget starter kit** cloned and dependencies installed
- [ ] **Development server** running without errors
- [ ] **Bundle URL** accessible at http://localhost:8080/js/1fe-bundle.js
- [ ] **Hot reloading** working when you make code changes

</div>

## 🎉 Success!

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional widget development environment. Your widget is compiled, served locally, and ready for development.

## 👉 Next Step

Now that your development environment is ready, let's learn how to use the 1fe Playground to develop and test your widget interactively.

**→ [Step 2: Using the Playground for Development](/tutorials/developing-your-first-widget/using-playground/)**

In the next step, you'll load your widget in the playground and start the interactive development workflow.

:::tip[Organization Integration]
Once you're comfortable with this standard workflow, ask your platform team about organization-specific development tools. The concepts you're learning here apply to any custom tooling your organization provides!
