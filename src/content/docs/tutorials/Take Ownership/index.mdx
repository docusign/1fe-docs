Ready to take complete control of your 1fe ecosystem? This tutorial guides platform teams through the essential steps to establish ownership, standardization, and scalability across your organization's 1fe implementation.

## <SlUser style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Who is this for?

This tutorial is designed for **platform teams** who need to:

<div class="prose">

- **Standardize widget development** across multiple teams and repositories
- **Automate build, test, and deployment** processes for widgets and the 1fe app
- **Provide custom utilities and services** to widget developers through platformProps
- **Ensure a stable and secure** 1fe ecosystem at enterprise scale
- **Create a consistent developer experience** across the organization

</div>

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

**Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:**

<div class="prose">

- **Completed** the [Setup and Deploy a 1fe POC](/tutorials/setup-and-deploy-1fe-poc/) tutorial
- **A working 1fe instance** with at least one widget deployed
- **Administrative access** to your organization's infrastructure and repositories
- **Authority to create** shared repositories, CI/CD templates, and publish packages
- **Understanding** of your organization's development standards and practices

</div>

## <SlTarget style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

<div class="prose">

- **Shared configurations** that enforce consistent standards across all widget repositories
- **Automated CI/CD pipelines** for both widgets and your 1fe app with quality gates and deployment automation
- **Custom shell types** that provide type-safe access to your organization's platformProps
- **Standardized developer workflow** that scales across teams and projects

## <SlClock style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Tutorial Overview

This tutorial consists of three progressive steps that build your organizational control:

### Step 1: Standardize with Shared Configurations

**Time: ~30 minutes**

Create shared configuration templates for consistent widget development across your organization.

**â†’ [Step 1: Standardize with Shared Configurations](/tutorials/take-ownership/shared-configurations/)**

### Step 2: Automate with CI/CD Pipelines

**Time: ~45 minutes**

Build reusable CI/CD templates for widgets and your 1fe app with quality gates and deployment automation.

**â†’ [Step 2: Automate with CI/CD Pipelines](/tutorials/take-ownership/ci-cd-pipelines/)**

### Step 3: Customize with Shell Types

**Time: ~25 minutes**

Define and implement custom platformProps with type-safe shell types for your organization's 1fe ecosystem.

**â†’ [Step 3: Customize with Shell Types](/tutorials/take-ownership/custom-shell-types/)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, your organization will have:

<div class="prose">

- **Consistent development standards** enforced automatically across all widget projects
- **Reduced onboarding time** for new developers with standardized tooling and workflows
- **Improved code quality** through automated testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Faster development cycles** with streamlined CI/CD processes
- **Type-safe development** with custom platformProps and shell types
- **Scalable infrastructure** that grows with your organization
