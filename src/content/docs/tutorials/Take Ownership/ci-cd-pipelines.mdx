A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for a healthy and scalable 1fe ecosystem. You'll create reusable CI/CD templates that ensure consistent quality and deployment processes across all your widgets and your 1fe app.

## üì¶ For Widget Repositories

Create a standardized CI/CD pipeline that all widget repositories can use:

<div class="prose">

- **Code Quality** - Automated linting, unit tests, and security scans
- **Build Process** - Consistent widget building using the 1fe CLI
- **Asset Publishing** - Automated publishing of widget bundles to your CDN
- **Release Management** - Automated updates to your configuration provider
- **Rollback Capability** - Safe deployment practices with easy rollback options

</div>

## üèóÔ∏è For Your 1fe App

Your 1fe app needs its own specialized CI/CD pipeline:

<div class="prose">

- **Quality Assurance** - Linting, unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning
- **Shell Deployment** - Build and deploy the shell application to your CDN
- **Server Deployment** - Build and deploy the server to your hosting provider
- **Type Publishing** - Publish updated shell types to your private NPM registry
- **Environment Management** - Deploy to staging and production environments safely

</div>

**‚Üí [See example CI/CD pipeline for 1fe apps](https://github.com/docusign/1fe-ci-cd/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-starter-app.yml)**

:::tip[Start Simple, Scale Up]
Begin with basic CI/CD pipelines that cover the essentials, then gradually add more sophisticated features like automated testing, security scanning, and advanced deployment strategies as your team grows comfortable with the processes.
