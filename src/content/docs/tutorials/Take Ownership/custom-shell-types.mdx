import { SlShield, SlCheck, SlArrowRight } from "react-icons/sl";
import { FcSafe } from "react-icons/fc";

# <SlShield style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Step 3: Customize with Shell Types

1fe allows you to provide custom utilities, services, and other `platformProps` to your widgets. To ensure type safety and an excellent developer experience, you'll create and publish your own shell types package that reflects your organization's specific platformProps.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Custom Shell Types Matter

<div class="prose">

- **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Developer Experience** - IntelliSense and autocomplete for your custom platformProps
- **Documentation** - Types serve as living documentation of available platform services
- **Consistency** - Ensure all widgets use platform services correctly

</div>

## ðŸ“¦ What You'll Implement

<div class="prose">

- Custom `platformProps` definition in your 1fe app
- Shell types package creation and publishing workflow
- Integration with your widget starter kit
- Versioning strategy for shell types updates

</div>

:::tip[Version Management]
Establish a clear versioning strategy for your shell types. Consider using semantic versioning and maintain backward compatibility when possible to avoid breaking existing widgets.
