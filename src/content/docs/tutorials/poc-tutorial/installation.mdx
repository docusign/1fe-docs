import { SlWrench, SlAnchor, SlCloudDownload, SlTarget } from "react-icons/sl";

In this first part of our proof of concept tutorial, you'll set up a local 1fe instance from scratch. This will give you hands-on experience with the core architecture and help you understand how 1fe works at a fundamental level.

## <SlTarget style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> What You'll Learn

- How to scaffold a new 1fe instance
- The structure of a 1fe application
- How the server and shell components work together
- Local development workflow and tools

## <SlAnchor style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Pre-requisites

- Node.js 22.x.x+
- Yarn 4.x.x+

## <SlCloudDownload style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> Manual Installation

<div className="prose">
1. **Scaffold a starter application:**

```bash
npx @1fe/create-1fe-app <test-app-name>
```

2. **Clone the 1fe widget starter kit (WSK):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docusign/1fe-widget-starter-kit.git
```

3. **Set up both the repos:**

First you need to build the 1fe monorepo and the starter kit.

```bash
cd <test-app-name> # adjust this to fit your directory structure
yarn && yarn build
```

Then, you need to set up the starter kit.

```bash
cd 1fe-widget-starter-kit # adjust this to fit your directory structure
yarn
```

4. **Run the starter app development server**

```bash
cd <test-app-name> # adjust this to fit your directory structure
yarn dev
```

You can now visit your instance at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will see this mirror our demo website [here](https://demo.1fe.com/). We will take a look later at how to customize this instance.

5. **Run the development server for the WSK**

```bash
cd 1fe-widget-starter-kit/ # adjust this to fit your directory structure
yarn dev
```

This will open WSK at the following [link](http://localhost:3001/playground?widgetUrl=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8080%2Fjs%2F1fe-bundle.js).

You now have a functioning 1fe instance running locally! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ¯ What You've Accomplished

- âœ… **Set up a complete 1fe development environment**
- âœ… **Created your first 1fe instance** with server and shell components
- âœ… **Understood the basic architecture** of how 1fe works
- âœ… **Got hands-on experience** with the scaffolding and setup process

## ðŸ‘‰ Next Step

Now that you have a working 1fe instance, it's time to learn how to build widgets and understand the development workflow.

**â†’ [Step 2: Develop Your First Widget](/tutorials/poc-tutorial/develop-locally/)**

In the next step, you'll create a custom widget, learn about platform utilities, and see how widgets integrate with the 1fe ecosystem.
