Let's get your 1fe instance ready for production! We shall cover the following topics in this guide:

## Quick Start Checklist

:::tip[Recommended Setup Order]
Follow these steps in order for the smoothest setup experience:

1. [Setup Hosting Service](/infrastructure/hosting-setup/) - Deploy your 1FE application
2. [Setup CDN](/infrastructure/cdn-setup/) - Configure widget bundle hosting  
3. [Setup NPM Registry](/infrastructure/npm-registry-setup/) - Manage NPM packages
4. [Setup Configuration Service](/infrastructure/configuration-setup/) - Manage live configurations
5. [Setup CI/CD](/infrastructure/project-setup/) - Automate deployments
:::

Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring your production infrastructure is robust and scalable.

Your 1fe application shell needs to be hosted on a reliable service that can handle user traffic and serve your application globally.

## <FaCloud style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#1F8BF3' }} /> 2. Setup a Static Hosting Service for Your Bundles

You can use a CDN service to host your built widget bundles for both integration and production environments.

**[→ Detailed CDN Setup Guide](/infrastructure/cdn-setup/)**


## <FaNpm style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#CB3837' }} /> 3. Setup a NPM Registry

A private NPM registry is essential for managing your 1fe widget packages securely and efficiently in a production environment.

## <FaDatabase style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#4CAF50' }} /> 4. Setup a Configuration Service


1fe requires a configuration service to manage **widget metadata** including version information, deployment status, and dependencies.

## <FaGithub style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle', color: '#181717' }} /> 5. Setup a CI/CD System

1fe uses a centralized CI/CD system to manage deployments across all widgets.
