title: Externalizing Common Libraries
description: 'How to externalize a library'
---

To externalize a library from ALL widget bundles, add the library metadata to `cdn.libraries.managed` of your Live Configurations. 

After adding the library information, 1fe/cli will automatically externalize the library from all widget bundles, and will be provided by the 1fe runtime to all widgets.

## `cdn.libraries.managed` example

**Type**
```tsx
type ExternalLibConfig = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  path: string;
  isPreloaded: boolean;
  type: 'external';
};
```

**Live Configurations**
```json
{
  "cdn": {
    "libraries": {
      "basePrefix": "https://your-cdn.net/libs/",
      "managed": [
        {
          "id": "lodash",
          "name": "lodash",
          "version": "4.17.21",
          "isPreloaded": true,
          "path": "lodash.js",
          "type": "external"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


This snippet will empower 1fe to do the following:

1. 1fe/cli will externalize lodash when building widget bundles

2. 1fe/shell will preload lodash from `https://your-cdn.net/libs/lodash/4.17.21/lodash.js` at runtime.
