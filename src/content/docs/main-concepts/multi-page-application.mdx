## <FcDocument style={{ display: 'inline', marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> What are Multi Page Applications

A **Multi-Page Application** (MPA) is a web application where each page is served as a separate HTML document, with the browser loading a new page every time the user navigates.

A **Single-Page Application** (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app.

Within 1fe, the app shell behaves as an MPA, where each Plugin is served its own HTML document.

## Why Multi Page Applications?

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: CSP is configured per page to add a layer of security in the browser to protect users from risks like XSS attacks. Since CSP is tied to the page, all plugins shared the same CSP. This exposed some security concerns and increased risk of regressions.
- **JS / CSS / Namespace collisions**: Because the page is never reloaded, there is the inherent risk of conflicts and collisions between plugins. This could include multiple versions of global libraries being loaded, writing window variables, global css causing classname conflicts, namespace collisions when using web apis, etc.
- **Less Flexibility**: Library versions are loaded on a per page basis. In the event of a major upgrade, all plugins would have to migrate at once. MPAs provide more flexibility in the event of migrations.
