### What’s the scope of 1fe?

The 1fe platform gives the central team a larger horizontal charter, responsibility, governance, and scope encapsulating the development, deployment, and execution of the entire front-end ecosystem.

### What is a widget?

A *widget* is ANY snippet of JavaScript logic that runs in a browser. A widget lives in its own GitHub repository, owns its own end-to-end CICD pipeline, and release management (all of which is orchestrated by 1fe), and runs perfectly well in the 1fe Playground, a widget, or a plugin.

### What is a plugin?

A *plugin* is a widget that is tied to a URL.

### What is 1fe Playground?

Teams are able to develop their widgets locally in development mode without any dependency on the 1fe runtime.

### Should an experience be a reusable/UI component (@ds/ui) or a widget?

Good question; let’s break it down.

**Design System Component**: A simple atomic presentation component that has little to no logic and can be widely reused from a designer’s perspective.

**Widget**: A component/library code that needs to be shipped, managed, and maintained independently and have its own release cadence. This could be due to one of many reasons:

1.  Business logic is introduced to a simple component, making it specific or targeted to a product, flow, or use case.
2.  The component has grown large enough; for example, a rich text editor.
3.  Heavy development (fixes/features) of a component that is widely shared/reused/consumed.

### What initialization/bootstrap data will be available to a widget?

Plugins and widgets can expect three sets of scoped top-level properties:

1.  `platform`: Properties from the 1fe platform (information about the environment, browser info, user data if possible, runtime widget hierarchy, and common utilities).
2.  `host`: [Optional] Properties from the host widget (if any) for successful integration with the help of feature flags, configuration API, data, or dependent functions; for example, `props.host.previewExperience.enabled`. Widgets that expose an API for other widgets to consume them will rely on the `_host_` property for configuration, bootstrapping, and initialization.
3.  `children`: [Optional] Child properties from the host widget, if it uses your widget as an HOC/wrapper.

A sample structure of properties can be seen in the 1fe Playground's properties editor.
