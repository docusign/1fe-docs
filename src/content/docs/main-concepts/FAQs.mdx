### What’s the scope of 1fe?

1fe Platform gives the central team a larger horizontal charter, responsibility, governance, and scope encapsulating the Development, Deployment, and Execution of the entire front-end ecosystem.

### What is a Widget?

A Widget is ANY snippet of javascript logic that runs in a browser. A Widget lives in its own GitHub repository, owns its own end-to-end CICD pipeline, and release management (all of which is orchestrated by 1fe), and runs perfectly well in the 1fe Playground, a Widget, or a Plugin.

### What is a Plugin?

A Plugin is a Widget that is TIED to a URL.

### What is 1fe Playground?

Teams are able to develop their Widgets locally in development mode without any dependency on the 1fe runtime.

### Should an experience be a Reusable/UI Component (@ds/ui) or a Widget?

Good question, let’s break it down.

**Design System Component** - A simple atomic presentation component that has little to no logic and can be widely reused from a designer’s perspective.

**Widget** - A component/library code that needs to be shipped, managed, and maintained independently and have its own release cadence. This could be due to one of many reasons:

1. Business logic is introduced to a simple component making it specific or targeted to a product, flow, or usecase.
2. The component has grown large enough - eg. Rich Text Editor
3. Heavy development (fixes/features) of a component that is widely shared/reused/consumed.

### What initialization/bootstrap data will be available to a Widget?

Plugins/Widgets can expect 3 sets of scoped top-level properties:

1. `platform` - Props from the 1fe platform (information about the environment, browser info, user data if possible, runtime widget hierarchy, and common utils).

2. `host` - [Optional] Props from the host widget (if any) for successful integration with the help of feature flags, configuration API, data or dependent functions. Ex: props.host.previewExperience.enabled. Widgets that expose an API for other Widgets to consume them will rely on the _host_ prop for configuration, bootstrapping and initialization.

3. `children` - [Optional] Children props from the host widget if it uses your widget as an HOC/wrapper.

Sample structure of props can be seen in the 1fe Playground's props editor.
