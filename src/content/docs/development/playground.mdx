The 1fe Playground helps teams to:

- verify Widget compatibility with the larger 1fe ecosystem
- test the integration between itself and another widget (e.g.: @ndse/send calling @ndse/prepare)
- sanity check/test their work before they can fully migrate into 1fe
- preview the runtime props passed down to their widget at runtime
- verify PR quality by dynamically running automation against preview CDN builds

The 1fe Playground is available for teams that want to develop without the entire shell, or the host plugin in place; they can always test their widget/integration in the 1fe Playground. The idea here is to enable a super easy way to set up and ensure a low barrier of entry.

The Playground has the critical infrastructure available and provides a mocked environment (for features like the utilities on platformProps) in place that enforces the **“guaranteed execution and dependencies provided at runtime”**.
