### Importing 1fe Platform Utilities

```tsx
import { platformProps } from "@1fe/shell";
```

:::note
The `@1fe/shell` package is automatically installed in your widget or plugin project using the latest `@1fe/cli`.
:::

The above approach is also known as **shell import syntax** or **1fe contextual injection**.

### Basic Usage of 1fe utilities

```tsx
// The 1fe shell provided the platform utilities to all widgets loaded in 1fe
import { PlatformPropsType, platformProps } from "@1fe/shell";

// This type is for reference and is included out of the box in the widget-starter-kit
interface WidgetProps {
  platform: PlatformPropsType;
  host?: HostPropType;
}

const MyWidget = (props: WidgetProps) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // this is how you access all utilities; use these docs for examples
    platformProps.utils.experience.setTitle("foo bar");
  }, []);

  return <>{/* ... */}</>;
};

export default MyWidget;
```

### How does the contextual injection work?

In a nutshell, the `@1fe/shell` is a simple types package to provide intellisense to the developer. In practice, there's no code that is being shipped in the `@1fe/shell` package. Instead, when your widget is loaded inside of 1fe, we intercept the request to load the `@1fe/shell` package and inject `platformProps` contextualized to your widget.

Using the contextual injection, you can access the `platformProps` from anywhere in your widget without having to pass it down as a property. Additionally this now enables us to safely provide some convenience React hooks from the 1fe platform.

#### Why contextual injection?

- **No prop drilling**: No more prop drilling through the code.
- **Stability of references**: Stability of references for things such as Widgets.get, etc.
- **No need for React contexts**: No need for a shared context between widgets.
- **Platform hooks**: We can now pass hooks from platformProps with a stable reference and not have to worry about the React rule of hooks being voided.
- **Access outside of the React lifecycle**: Access utilities such as `logger` outside of the React lifecycle.
- **Syntax sugar**: The syntax is concise and easy to use.
