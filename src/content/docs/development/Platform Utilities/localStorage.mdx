## `platformProps.utils.localStorage`

Access the localStorage utility through the platform properties and call its functions directly. The utility is exposed as `platformProps.utils.localStorage`.
Key has to be of type `string`, and each key will be prefixed by the widgetId, which is referenced as namespace in the util. For example a key will be stored as `widgetId.key` in localStorage.
Value can be of type `boolean`, `number` or `string`. In the future this will be extended to complex types such as objects.

This API is available only through `platformProps.utils`.

## Your use of storage is an API

:::caution
Namespacing storage keys to your widgetId does not prevent keys or values from being shared between multiple instances or versions of the same widget. Any change has the potential to break if it is not compatiple with the previous version of your widget. Any changes should be made with extreme caution.

This consideration is especially important for pinned widgets, which will be rendered alongside older versions of their own widget.

### `set`

```ts
function set(key: string, value: string | number | boolean): void;
```

This function will set a namespace prefixed key and value in localStorage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.set("key1", true);
platformProps.utils.localStorage.set("key2", 100);
platformProps.utils.localStorage.set("key3", test);
```

### `get`

```ts
function get(key: string): string | boolean | number;
```

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.get("key1");
```

### `getAll`

```ts
function getAll(): Record<string, T>;
```

`getAll` will return an object containing all the keys and corresponding values stored in local storage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.getAll();
```

### `clear`

```ts
function clear(): void;
```

`clear` will remove all keys and values from localStorage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.clear();
```

### `remove`

```ts
function remove(key: string): void;
```

`remove` will delete the specific key from localStorage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.remove("key1");
```

### `size`

```ts
function size(): number;
```

`size` will return total number of keys that are stored in localStorage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.size();
```

### `keys`

```ts
function keys(): string[];
```

This function will return all keys that are in localStorage.

#### Example

```tsx
platformProps.utils.localStorage.keys();
```

### Setup

To use the localStorage utilities in any widget, add localStorage functions to platformProps.

```tsx
export type PlatformProps = {
  utils: {
    localStorage: {
      readonly set: (key: string, value: string | number | boolean) => void;
      readonly get: <T extends string | number | boolean>(key: string) => T;
      readonly getAll: <T_1 extends string | number | boolean>() => Record<
        string,
        T_1
      >;
      readonly clear: () => void;
      readonly remove: (key: string) => void;
      readonly size: () => number | undefined;
      readonly keys: () => string[];
    };
  };
};
```

### Errors

An error will be thrown in case of an exception due to the store2 library in the abscence of a widgetId or when the functions are invoked incorrectly.

To learn more about using any of the store2 functions, refer to its [public documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/store2).
