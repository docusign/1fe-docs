**Audience:** Platform teams setting up production configuration management infrastructure for their organization.

A configuration service is essential for managing 1fe widget settings, feature flags, and environment-specific configurations. This guide covers how to set up Azure App Configuration as the foundation for automated widget data recording.

</div>

## Why You Need a Configuration Service

### Configuration Management Benefits
- ⚡ **Live configuration updates** - Change widget behavior without redeployment
- 🏗️ **Environment separation** - Different settings for integration and production
- 🎛️ **Feature flags** - Enable/disable features dynamically across widgets
- 🧪 **A/B testing** - Configure different experiences for user segments
- ↩️ **Rollback capability** - Quickly revert configuration changes

### What Gets Automatically Stored
Our CI/CD pipelines automatically record and manage:
- 📋 **Widget metadata** - Version information, deployment status, change history
- 📅 **Deployment records** - Timestamps, environment targets, build artifacts
- ⚙️ **Runtime settings** - API endpoints, feature toggles, UI configurations
- 🌍 **Environment configurations** - Integration and production-specific settings
- 🚩 **Feature flags** - Dynamic feature enabling/disabling status

## Azure App Configuration Setup

### Why We Use Azure App Configuration

**Benefits for 1fe:**
- 📝 **Configuration versioning** - Track changes over time with labels
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** - Push configuration changes to applications

### Azure App Configuration Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through creating a new Azure App Configuration resource and adding key-value pairs to it using the Azure Portal.

**Setup Instructions:**

<div className="prose">
1. **Access the Azure Portal**
   - Open your web browser and go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Log in with your Azure account credentials

2. **Navigate to App Configuration**
   - In the search bar at the very top of the portal, type **App Configuration**
   - From the search results, select **App Configuration services**

3. **Create a New Resource**
   - On the App Configuration services page, click the **+ Create** button (usually located at the top-left)
   - This will open a form to configure your new App Configuration resource

4. **Configure Resource Settings**
   - **Subscription**: Use the dropdown to select the Azure subscription you want to use
   - **Resource group**: Select an existing one or click **Create new** and give it a name (e.g., `1fe-resources`)
   - **Resource name**: Enter a unique name for your App Configuration instance (e.g., `1fe-config-yourname`)
   - **Location**: Choose the geographic region where you want to host this service
   - **Pricing tier**: Select **Standard** for most cases (recommended)

5. **Review and Create**
   - Click the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the form
   - Azure will validate your settings
   - After validation passes, click the **Create** button to start deployment

6. **Access Your Configuration Store**
   - After deployment is complete, click **Go to resource**
   - This takes you to the overview page for your new App Configuration resource

7. **Get Connection String**
   - In your App Configuration resource, go to **Settings** > **Access keys**
   - Copy the **Connection string** under either the **Read-write** or **Read-only** key
   - Store this securely for use in your CI/CD pipelines
</div>

:::note[Automatic Configuration Management]
**Widget configurations are automatically created by CI/CD pipelines** during deployment. You don't need to manually add key-value pairs. The pipelines will:

- 📝 **Create widget metadata entries** when widgets are deployed
- 🔄 **Update version information and deployment status**
- 📚 **Maintain historical records** of widget changes
- 🏷️ **Manage environment-specific configurations** using labels

To view your widget data, go to **Settings** > **Configuration explorer** after your first widget deployment.
:::

:::tip[Automated Key Naming Convention]
Our pipelines automatically use consistent naming patterns:
- `integration:@1fe/playground` - Widget-specific settings (format: `env:widget-name`)
:::

### Environment Configuration

**Automated Label Strategy:**
Our CI/CD pipelines automatically use these labels for environment separation:
- `integration` - Integration environment settings
- `production` - Production environment settings

**Key Naming Convention:**
```
integration:@1fe/playground  # Widget-specific (format: env:widget-name)
```
