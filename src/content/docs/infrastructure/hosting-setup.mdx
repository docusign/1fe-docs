**Audience:** Platform teams setting up production hosting infrastructure for their organization.

Your 1fe application shell needs to be hosted on a reliable service that can handle user traffic and serve your application globally. This guide covers how to deploy your 1fe instance to production hosting services.

</div>

## Why You Need a Hosting Service

A hosting service provides:

- **Application shell hosting** - Serves your main 1fe application
- **Static file serving** - HTML, CSS, JS files for your shell
- **Global availability** - Ensures your app is accessible worldwide
- **SSL/TLS termination** - Secure HTTPS connections
- **Load balancing** - Handle traffic spikes and ensure reliability

### Azure Web App (Recommended for Enterprise)

:::note[Why Azure Web App for 1fe]

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) with built-in CI/CD integration**  
- üîó **Seamless integration with Azure ecosystem and enterprise services**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in security, scalability, and monitoring features**

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring an Azure Web App that allows replication of the 1fe-demo setup.

#### Step 1: Introduction to Azure App Service

Azure App Service is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends. It supports various programming languages and provides built-in features like continuous deployment, security, and scalability. A key component of an App Service is the App Service Plan, which defines the underlying compute resources (CPU, memory, storage) for your app.

**Official Documentation:** [Azure App Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)

#### Step 2: Create a New Web App

The first step is to create the core Web App resource.

**Setup Instructions:**

9. **Select Region**
   - **Region**: Select a region close to your users (e.g., `Central US`)

10. **Proceed to Deployment Configuration**
    - Click **Next: Deployment** to continue
</div>

#### Step 3: Configure Deployment from GitHub

This section details how to enable continuous deployment from a GitHub repository, so that every time you push a change, your web app is automatically updated.

**Setup Instructions:**

<div className="prose">
1. **Navigate to Deployment Tab**
   - On the **Deployment** tab during Web App creation (or by navigating to Deployment Center for an existing app)

2. **Enable Continuous Deployment**
   - Set **Continuous deployment** to `Enable`

3. **Select GitHub as Source**
   - **Source**: Select `GitHub`

4. **Authorize Azure to Access GitHub**
   - You may need to authorize Azure to access your GitHub account
   - Follow the prompts to sign in to GitHub

5. **Grant Necessary Permissions**
   - Grant the necessary permissions when prompted

6. **Select Your GitHub Organization**
   - **Organization**: Select your GitHub organization from the dropdown

7. **Choose Your Repository**
   - **Repository**: Select the repository containing your application code

8. **Select Deployment Branch**
   - **Branch**: Select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main` or `production`)

9. **Review and Create Web App**
   - Click **Review + create** to review all settings

10. **Complete Web App Creation**
    - Click **Create** to create the Web App
    - Azure will automatically generate a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository to handle deployments
</div>

**Official Documentation:** [Deploy to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions)

**Example Implementation:** [1fe Starter App CI Workflow](https://github.com/docusign/1fe-starter-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

#### Step 4: Add and Configure a Custom Domain

Your Web App has a default domain (e.g., `1fe-demo.azurewebsites.net`), but you will likely want to use a custom domain.

**Setup Instructions:**

<div className="prose">
1. **Navigate to Your Web App Resource**
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Web App resource

2. **Access Custom Domains Section**
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Custom domains**

3. **Start Adding Custom Domain**
   - Click **+ Add custom domain**

4. **Select Your DNS Provider**
   - **Domain provider**: Select your DNS provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Cloudflare)

5. **Enter Your Domain Name**
   - Enter the domain name you want to use (e.g., `demo.yourdomain.com`)

6. **Review DNS Record Requirements**
   - The portal will provide you with DNS record information to validate ownership

7. **Create Required DNS Records**
   - You will need to create a TXT and/or a CNAME record with your domain registrar
   - Use the DNS information provided by Azure

8. **Validate Domain Ownership**
   - Once the DNS records are created, click **Validate** in the Azure Portal

9. **Complete Domain Addition**
   - After validation is successful, click **Add custom domain**
</div>

:::note[App Service Plan Requirement]
Your App Service plan must be a paid tier (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium) to add a custom domain. The Free (F1) and Shared (D1) tiers do not support custom domains.
:::

**Official Documentation:** [Set up an existing custom domain name for your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain)

#### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Environment variables (known as "Application settings" in Azure) are a secure way to manage configuration values, such as API keys or database connection strings, without hard-coding them into your application.

**Setup Instructions:**

<div className="prose">
1. **Navigate to Your Web App Resource**
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Web App resource

2. **Access Configuration Section**
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Configuration**

3. **Open Application Settings Tab**
   - On the **Application settings** tab, click **+ New application setting**

4. **Enter Variable Name**
   - Enter the **Name** for your environment variable

5. **Enter Variable Value**
   - Enter the **Value** for your environment variable

6. **Confirm Variable Addition**
   - Click **OK** to confirm the new setting

7. **Save Configuration Changes**
   - Click **Save** at the top of the page

8. **Wait for App Restart**
   - The app will restart automatically to apply the new settings

9. **Handle Nested JSON Configuration (If Needed)**
   - For nested JSON keys (e.g., `Logging:LogLevel:Default`)
   - Replace the colons (`:`) with double underscores (`__`) in the name
   - Example: `Logging__LogLevel__Default`
</div>

:::caution[App Restart Required]
The app will restart automatically when you save new application settings. Plan configuration changes during appropriate maintenance windows.
